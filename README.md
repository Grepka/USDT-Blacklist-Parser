USDT Multi-Single Contract Parser

This project is designed to parse and analyze USDT multi-single contracts (USDT ETH/USDT TRX 20) and USDC smart contracts. It decodes wallet addresses and lock codes, monitors transactions, and checks the current wallet balance. Additionally, it saves the data in CSV files and sends notifications to Telegram.
